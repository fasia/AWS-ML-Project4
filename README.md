# Operationalizing Machine Learning- Project 4
In this project, I used a pretrained model to find the best hyperparameters for training dogimages dataset. 
Then, I used the best hyperparameters to train a model and deploy an endpoint that predicts a dog breed from given image input.
The same practice is done in multi-instace and the same result is acheived.
I also created an EC2 instance to locally train a model, added a Lambda function to query an endpoint. 
I configured concurrency and auto-scaling for improved latency. Check the writeup report for the complete infromation.
